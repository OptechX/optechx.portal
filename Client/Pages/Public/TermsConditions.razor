OptechX empowers you to effortlessly create multiple SOE images tailored to different facets of your enterprise, from software and security to network and automation needs.

The user experience is finely tuned through collaboration with industry leaders like Lenovo, Dell, and Microsoft. OptechX’s intuitive dashboard offers a strategic overview of your computing environment, akin to having a GPS guiding your IT journey. While the platform itself isn’t customizable, it empowers you to fully customize your SOE development lifecycle, with continuous enhancements based on user feedback. As a dynamic SaaS product, OptechX is committed to innovation, regularly rolling out new features and developments. It harmoniously integrates with your existing technology stack, offering an API for seamless in-house software integration.
